.Nd grey listing filter for sendmail
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Fl d Ar dumpfile
.Op Fl f Ar exceptfile
.Op Fl w Ar delay
.Fl p Ar socket
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
is a mail filter for sendmail that implements grey listing,
a spam filtering technique proposed by Evan Harris.
.Pp
Grey listing works by assuming that contrarily to legitimate MTA, spam engines
will not retry sending their junk mail on a temporary error. The filter
will always temporarilly reject mail on a first attempt, and to 
accept it after some time has elapsed.
.Pp
If spammers ever try to resend rejected messages, we can assume they will 
not stay idle between the two sends. Odds are good that the spammer will 
send a mail to an honey pot address and get blacklisted in a distributed 
black list before the second attempt.
.Pp
Of course, the filter can be configured to not apply grey listing to some
hosts or networks. You can white list friendly SMTP servers, and you should
whitelist your own network, else your SMTP clients will have real trouble to 
send e-mail. Whitelisting localhost is also a must.
.Pp
.Nm
works with two files. 
.Pa except.conf
holds the white list of machines that will not suffer grey list filtering.
It is readen upon 
.Nm
startup and is left alone once started. The syntax of this file is simple:
it just consist of one pair of network address and CIDR netmask per line, 
separated by a / (slash). Here is an example:
.Dl 127.0.0.0/8
.Dl 192.168.3.0/24
.Pp
The second file is
.Pa greylist.db .
.Nm
will regularly dump its grey list database into this file, which is used
on startup to restore the previous grey list state. If the file does not
exists or is unreadable, 
.Nm
will start with an empty grey list. 
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl d Ar dumpfile
Location of the dump file. Default is 
.Pa /etc/mail/except.conf .
.It Fl f Ar exceptfile
Location of the white list file. Default is
.Pa /var/milter-greylist/greylist.db .
.It Fl p Ar socket
Use 
.Ar socket
as the socket used by 
.Xr sendmail 8
to talk with
.Nm .
This option is mandatory.
.It Fl v
Enable debug output. 
.Nm 
will send messages (and debug output if it is given the
.Fl v
flag) to 
.Xr syslogd 8
with facility LOG_MAIL.
.It Fl w Ar delay
sets the minimum delay (in seconds) between the first attempt and the time
the message can be accepted. Default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
